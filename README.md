What is NuseBites?
==================

NuseBites is a kick-ass application that will allow you to capitalize on social connections instantly (or whatever suits
your marketing ears). It takes input from different bidders and sells out your social network to the highest bidder for
cold hard cash. More importantly it is a vehicle that we use at a Spring Integration workshop to see if we can get a cool
back-end application running in a day or two.
